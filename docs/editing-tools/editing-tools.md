### Step 1: Open Your Image

To begin, open an image you'd like to work on. Here is our starting pointâ€”a cool-toned waterfall scene.

### Step 2: Get a Head Start with Auto Adjust

If you want a quick starting point, the **Auto Adjust** feature can provide a great initial edit. Right-click the image and select 'Auto Adjust'.

</p>

As you can see, this has instantly made the image a bit warmer and added some contrast, giving us a solid base to build upon.

### Step 3: Creative Color & Tone Adjustments

Now for the creative part. We can apply a 'filmic' S-curve in the **Curves** panel to deepen the contrast in a more nuanced way.

</p>

Next, in the **Color Mixer**, we can remove some of the greens and blues, as they aren't really needed here in this image (in my opinion). This helps simplify the color palette and adds to the autumn feel.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Image (5).png" width="50%">
</p>

The result is a soft, unique color grade that sets the mood.

### Step 4: Dialing in the Contrast

After our color changes, the image feels a bit flat. We can fix this by increasing the **Whites** and decreasing the **Blacks** to expand the dynamic range.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Image (7).png" width="50%">
</p>

This simple adjustment brings back the punch and depth to the scene.

### Step 5: Adding Pop with Detail and Presence

To make the image pop even more, we can use the **Details** and **Presence** panels. A touch of **Sharpening**, **Clarity**, and **Dehaze** will enhance the textures in the rocks and trees.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Image (9).png" width="50%">
</p>

The image is now much crisper and has more local contrast.

### Step 6: Improving the Composition with Crop

To keep the waterfall better in frame, we can crop the image slightly using the crop tool. This helps focus the viewer's attention.

### Step 7: The Final Touches

To give the image a final, polished look, we'll add a subtle vignette to darken the corners.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Image (11).png" width="50%">
</p>

Then, using the **Masking** tools, we'll create a soft, warm radial glow over the waterfall, increasing its **Temperature** and **Exposure** to make it the clear focal point.

### Step 8: The Final Edit

And now we have our final edit! By combining multiple tools, we've transformed a simple photo into a dramatic and moody scene.
