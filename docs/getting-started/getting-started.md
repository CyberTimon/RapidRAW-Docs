# Tutorial: Getting Started with RapidRAW

Welcome to your first editing session in RapidRAW! This guide will walk you through a common and efficient workflow: editing one image, saving that look as a preset, and then applying it to other photos for a consistent style.

### Step 1: Open RapidRAW

When you first launch the application, you'll see the welcome screen. Click the **"Open Folder"** button to select a folder of images from your computer.

### Step 2: Select Your Folder

Navigate to your desired folder in the system's file explorer and open it.

</p>

### Step 3: View Your Library

Once loaded, RapidRAW will display all the images from folder in the main library view.

### Step 4: Open an Image and Make Basic Adjustments

Double-click an image to open it in the main editor. The image below is the original, unedited RAW file.

</p>

Now, use the sliders in the right-hand panel to make some basic adjustments. We've increased the exposure, added contrast, increased the temperature and tweaked the colors to make the image pop.

### Step 5: Copy Your Adjustments

Now that you have a look you like, you don't have to repeat these steps for every photo. Right-click the edited image and select **Copy Adjustments**.

</p>

### Step 6: Paste Adjustments to Other Images

You can apply these exact settings to other photos. Select multiple images in the filmstrip (hold `Ctrl` or `Cmd` and click), then right-click and choose **Paste Adjustments**. This is a huge time-saver for creating a consistent look across a set of photos.

### Step 7: Create a Preset for Later Use

To save this look for future editing sessions, you can create a preset. In the **Presets** panel, click the "Create New Preset" icon, give it a name, and save it. Now you can apply this look with a single click anytime.

### Step 8: Apply Your Preset to a New Image

Let's open a completely different photo. Now, simply click on your newly created preset. The adjustments are instantly applied.

### Step 9: Fine-Tune with the Color Mixer

The preset looks good, but the blue in the water is now a bit too grey and desaturated. We can easily fix this. Go to the **Color Mixer** panel, select the blue color channel, and increase its **Saturation** to bring the color back.

### Step 10: Export Your Final Image

Perfect! The image is now ready to be shared. Click the **Export** button in the bottom left. In the export dialog, you can set your desired format (like JPEG), quality, and other options. Click **Export** to save your final image.
